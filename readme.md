I previously created an portfolio for Smit Chitroda with the following design specifications:
- Dark theme with glassmorphism effects (translucent cards with backdrop blur)
- Animated gradient background with floating shapes that respond to mouse movement
- Color scheme: Indigo (#6366f1), Cyan (#06b6d4), and Purple (#8b5cf6) accents against dark slate background
- Sections: Hero (with animated profile card), Skills Grid (category cards), Projects Grid (project cards with highlights), Education/Certifications, and Contact
- Mobile-responsive with smooth scroll animations and hover effects
- Professional, modern, tech-focused aesthetic suitable for AI/ML roles

I am now providing my resume below. Please:
1. Keep the EXACT same design theme, colors, animations, and layout structure
2. Ensure all skills, certifications, and experience match my new resume exactly
3. Keep the contact information updated with my current details
